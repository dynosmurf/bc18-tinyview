Battlecode 2018 Tiny Viewer
===========================

Tiny HTML5-based viewer for Battlecode 2018 replays. Not necessarily compliant with anything, as it was hacked out by manually inspecting replay files and doing what seemed right.

Run this by running a localhost server. For instance, suppose you have the following file structure:

```
battlecode/
    replays/
        replay-1.bc18
        replay-2.bc18
    bc18-tinyview/ [this repository]
        index.html
        README.md
```

Then run `python -m http.server 8080` in the `battlecode/` directory. Then navigate to `localhost:8080/bc18-tinyview/index.html`. Then type `/replays/replay-1.bc18` in the "filename" input and hit enter. It should now start loading the replay and will start the animation once it's done loading.

Adjust the "10" in the input below it to change the number of milliseconds between each frame (so larger is slower). Hit enter to apply the new speed.

Hit "Reset" to, well, reset and start the animation over from the beginning.

This viewer is not very good and needs improvement. Fork this repository and make pull requests and I will merge them when I'm paying attention. General things that need to be done:
 - Make sure we're not making off-by-one-turn errors with when things should be rendered
 - Visualize Mars at all
 - Distinguish between different types of units (started)
 - Visualize health bars on units
 - Make visualizations for attacks that make clear who is attacking whom
 - Show how many of each kind of unit each player has
 - Implement a scrubber (mostly done)
